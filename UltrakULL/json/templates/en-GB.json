        "visualnovel_nihilismPrompt3": "Nothing we do matters in the end, and that is precisely why we are not shackled by the burden of expectations, the fear of eternal judgement or the failure to meet up to an arbitrary definition of what makes our limited time 'not wasted'.",
        "visualnovel_nihilismPrompt4": "Time cannot be wasted, for there is no greater purpose to life than simply living it.",
        "visualnovel_nihilismPrompt5": "Quite the contrary.",
        "visualnovel_nihilismPrompt6": "Because we have no greater purpose, we are free to set our own. To create self-defined goals for which to strive.",
        "visualnovel_nihilismPrompt7": "For some it may be nothing. For some it may be pleasure. For some it may be creation. For some it may be improving the lives of others.",
        "visualnovel_nihilismPrompt8": "It is because we have no greater purpose, that time spent on goals set by one's self cannot be time wasted.",
        "visualnovel_nihilismPrompt9": "In the end, nothing matters, and therefore you have no reason not to do what you want rather than whatever illusion of greater purpose is forced on you by others or even your own misguided thoughts.",
        "visualnovel_nihilismPrompt10": "And it is a thought worth fearing. However, abandoning purpose, hope, choice, goals, pleasure and will can not make that thought disappear. The fear, however, can subside.",
        "visualnovel_nihilismPrompt11": "Giving up is not accepting the end, it is simply accepting the fear of it. It is embracing despair rather than facing it.",
        "visualnovel_nihilismPrompt12": "This is true. The emotional is not controlled by the logical. However, they are interlinked.",
        "visualnovel_nihilismPrompt13": "Just as the deepest, darkest depths of despair can overthrow reason and the logical, warping them to fit into that haze of depression, so too can reason influence and overpower emotion, regardless of how impenetrable its defences may seem.",
        "visualnovel_nihilismPrompt14": "By continually forcing to subvert those creeping negative thoughts with the positive logical ones, the emotional mind will eventually, slowly, gradually start to shape to fit the logical.",
        "visualnovel_nihilismPrompt15": "It is not an easy job.",
        "visualnovel_nihilismPrompt16": "It is not a quick job.",
        "visualnovel_nihilismPrompt17": "It will sometimes feel like an impossible job.",
        "visualnovel_nihilismPrompt18": "However, it can be done.",
        "visualnovel_nihilismPrompt19": "With an immense amount of time, effort and energy, it will improve.",
        "visualnovel_nihilismPrompt20": "You can change.",
        "visualnovel_nihilismPrompt21": "You can heal.",
        "visualnovel_nihilismPrompt22": "And during the hardest times, when all seems lost and you want to give up, never forget...",
        "visualnovel_nihilismPrompt23": "We will always love you.",
        
        "visualnovel_nihilism34": "Huh?",
        "visualnovel_nihilism35": "How could it not be?",
        "visualnovel_nihilism36": "But still, in that case, the meaninglessness of our actions draws to the same conclusion -- There is no reason to act, for any action is simply a temporary fluctuation that will, nevertheless, lead to the same conclusion.",
        
        "visualnovel_nihilism37": "I do understand what you mean.",
        "visualnovel_nihilism38": "However, that doesn't ease my fear of the end.", 
        "visualnovel_nihilism39": "Even if I were to try to find purpose, I would still be paralyzed by the thought of becoming nothing.",
        
        "visualnovel_nihilism40": "I see.",
        "visualnovel_nihilism41": "Though as much as I'd like to embrace it, I am nevertheless struck with that paralyzing existential panic.",
        "visualnovel_nihilism42": "I understand it logically, and I know that there is no reason to live in apathy, but my emotional side refuses to listen.",
        "visualnovel_nihilism43": "The fear persists, and I cannot motivate myself to seek purpose, despite knowing I must.",

        "visualnovel_conclusion7": "And honestly, from the bottom of my heart...",
        
        "visualnovel_conclusion8": "Thank you.",
        
        "visualnovel_conclusion9": "You've given me a lot to think about, and while I'm sure I have a long and hard road ahead of me, I'm optimistic. ",
        "visualnovel_conclusion10": "For the first time in what feels like an eternity, I'm optimistic.",
        
        "visualnovel_conclusion11": "Say... We're already way too late for school and it's become quite clear by now that nobody's going to come lead us there, so how about you and I ditch that passion-draining penitentiary and go grab something to eat, eh?",
        
        "visualnovel_conclusionPrompt1": "Yeah, sure. I've got nothing better to do today. You're paying, though.",
        "visualnovel_conclusionPrompt2": "Nah, sorry. To be honest I'm still kinda mad at for you how rude you were to me.",

        "visualnovel_conclusionResponseFirst2": "But alright.",

        "shop_loreRevolver2": "Weapons that use this technology have been dubbed \"electric guns\", and it quickly became the new standard, replacing bullet guns. Due to still requiring a microscopic projectile, its ammo is not actually infinite, but it would take weeks of non-stop firing to run out and refilling is as easy as just scraping some flakes from scrap metal or even the gun's surface.",
        "shop_loreRevolver3": "In fact, a rough, uneven surface from scraping flakes is considered a point of pride for wielders of electric guns, as it shows the weapon has been reliable and used for a long time. Many users even shave off flakes just for this reason, rather than for actual ammunition, making \"unflaked\" electric weapons an outlier.",
        "shop_loreRevolver4": "Although an electric gun requires some time to recharge its battery between shots, the revolver-style design bypasses that issue by including a multi-battery cylinder that rotates after each shot, allowing each battery time to charge without slowing down the fire-rate.",
        "shop_loreRevolver5": "A common modification is to allow for the charges of all batteries to be released simultaneously for greater power, though this requires a longer recharge time.",
        "shop_loreRevolver6": "Although it may seem weak at a glance, its power comes from its consistency and simplicity. The revolver is easy to use while focusing on movement and dodging attacks, because of the instant travel time of its shots and it functioning well at any range.",
        "shop_loreRevolver7": "Headshots deal 2x damage, limbshots 1.5x.",
        "shop_loreRevolver8": "When hit with precise timing during its flash, the Marksman variation's coin can split a shot in two, causing it to hit two targets instead of just one. Although the timing is tight, there is a second much longer window if the coin remains airborne for an extended period of time, recognisable by its continuous whistling sound.",
        "shop_loreRevolver9": "The Marksman variation's coin can be punched after it has flashed, launching it into the nearest target without breaking the coin, increasing its damage further for subsequent punches or shots.",

        "shop_loreShotgun1": "An experimental close range weapon that uses hyperconcentrated heat as its projectiles.",
        "shop_loreShotgun2": "After each shot, the shotgun must be opened to allow its heat-generating cores to vent excess heat, stopping them from melting or exploding. This process is largely automated, requiring little more from the user than a flick of the wrist.",
        "shop_loreShotgun3": "In case of core failure, the pump can be used as a manual heat building mechanism. This process has been simplified via a small button near the grip that pumps the shotgun without requiring physical force from the user, though its ease of use has also greatly increased the reported amount of misfires from users pumping too much heat into a single shot.",
        "shop_loreShotgun4": "Heat weapons never caught on as much as electric weapons due to their volatile nature and strict cooling requirements, but unlike electric weapons, they don't require a separate projectile, making their ammunition truly infinite rather than just practically infinite.",
        "shop_loreShotgun5": "The shotgun is only effective at extremely close ranges, making it a risky but very devastating damage dealer. This also makes it ideal for healing.",
        "shop_loreShotgun6": "Can parry melee attacks via a point-blank shot to the chest. Riskier than using the Feedbacker arm, but with higher damage as a reward.",
        "shop_loreShotgun7": "Quickly swapping weapons skips the wait time after a shot, allowing for continuous bursts of massive damage at the risk of having to stay close for an extended period of time.",
        "shop_loreShotgun8": "The Core Eject variation's core can be shot out of the air via a hitscan weapon such as the Revolver to increase the radius and damage of its explosion. An already explosive hitscan will increase its radius even further.",
        "shop_loreShotgun9": "The slowness of the condensed heat projectiles may seem like a detriment at first, but this means that a well timed punch with the Feedbacker arm can hit them, parrying one's own shot for far greater accuracy, speed and damage.",
        
        "shop_loreNailgun1": "A combination of parts from an industrial nailgun and an old bullet gun. Most likely engineered by a machine that was built for construction work, as all machines, even those not built for war, had to learn to fend for themselves after the extinction of mankind.",
        "shop_loreNailgun2": "Bullet guns were largely abandoned after the invention of infinite ammunition systems such as electric weapons and heat weapons, largely due to how much cheaper not having to buy ammunition for large-scale armies becomes overtime.",
        "shop_loreNailgun3": "Although the original ammunition system made it useless and largely abandoned, this gun was still excellently designed and built, so with some retrofitting of parts from an industrial nailgun, it has become a rapid-fire projectile weapon with practically infinite metal ammunition.",
        "shop_loreNailgun4": "As is to be expected from an improvised weapon though, its design is far from perfect. As the nail regeneration system was not designed to work at such a high rate, it's liable to overheat if a hard rate limit isn't set on it, though some variants have instead opted for built-in heatsinks.",
        "shop_loreNailgun5": "Due to the nature of its limited ammunition, the nailgun is best used in short bursts rather than extended periods of time.",
        "shop_loreNailgun6": "The Magnet variation's magnets will also affect the nails from other nailgun variations, allowing the bypassing of otherwise limiting factors such as the burst from the Overheat variation having poor accuracy.",
        "shop_loreNailgun7": "Some enemies, such as Malicious Faces, are generally weak to nails, and in particular the higher quality nails from the hard-limited Magnet variation will decimate most weak foes.",
        "shop_loreNailgun8": "Nails become embedded in enemies, causing some special effects. Electric weapons will receive a damage boost from hitting an enemy that has nails in it, and with enough nails, light enemies become magnetized and pulled by the Magnet variation's magnets, allowing for easy temporary disabling of durable light enemies.",
        "shop_loreNailgun9": "The speed of the barrels' spin carries over between variations, meaning shooting even once with the Magnet variation gives maximum heat for the Overheat variation, allowing for an instant full overheat burst.",
        
        "shop_loreRailcannon1": "This industrial tool was one of the earliest uses for the technology that eventually became electric guns.",
        "shop_loreRailcannon2": "Originally meant as a handheld generator, allowing for an easy way to generate electricity for temporary relocation, such as encampments during wars or expeditions.",
        "shop_loreRailcannon3": "As with most similar industrial tools, once mankind fell, it was repurposed as a weapon by the machine that wielded it, turning it from a lower voltage constant output into a single extremely high burst of energy that requires a long recharge time between shots.",
        "shop_loreRailcannon4": "Although a risky weapon, since its recharge time is so long, the railcannon's power makes it a worthy tool to wield, especially for someone carrying multiple weapons that they can use while the railcannon's battery recharges.",
        "shop_loreRailcannon5": "Each variation serves a different purpose, and since they all share the same cooldown, it's important to know which version to use in any given situation.",
        "shop_loreRailcannon6": "Total recharge time is 15 seconds. Current charge is indicated by a lightning bolt on the HUD.",
        "shop_loreRailcannon7": "The Electric variation can hit the Marksman revolver's coins. Since it has infinite piercing power, with good timing and positioning one can shoot through an enemy to hit a coin, which will then ricochet the shot back into the same enemy, more than doubling the total damage dealt by a single shot.",
        "shop_loreRailcannon8": "By using the Feedbacker arm to punch an enemy that the Screwdriver variation's screw is attached to, it can be relaunched, dealing an extra burst of damage to the enemy. If the screw hits another enemy, its timer will be fully reset, meaning a screw can be juggled between enemies practically infinitely with good timing and aim, though it will break if the enemy it's attached to dies.",
        "shop_loreRailcannon9": "The Malicious variation's explosion range and damage can be greatly increased by hitting an airborne core from the Core Eject shotgun. This technique is highly risky, since missing means wasting the entire shot and having to wait another 15 seconds, but its rewards are bountiful.",
        
        "shop_loreRocketLauncher1": "Another weapon that used to be an industrial tool, as is visible from it and the railcannon's more vibrant color schemes compared to guns such as the revolver, shotgun and the nailgun, which uses a bullet weapon as its base.",
        "shop_loreRocketLauncher2": "As with most advanced technologies, it was originally created for use in war, as its explosive-generating system was extremely fast at digging trenches, destroying obstacles or resupplying explosive weapons.",
        "shop_loreRocketLauncher3": "However, this tool itself could not be used as a launcher. Early models doubled as weapons, but including the systems for triggering the explosives often caused accidental chemical reactions during their generation process, detonating the explosives before they had been completed.",
        "shop_loreRocketLauncher4": "Since then, the process has been split in two between the generating device and a separate rocket launcher, where the explosives generator builds the rest of a rocket and the rocket launcher applies the triggering mechanism.",
        "shop_loreRocketLauncher5": "As machines rarely have the luxury of co-operation due to sharing blood with others being seen as a waste, the machine that created this weapon instead modified the generation process to work with just a single user and repurposed parts from a jackhammer for launching the projectile.",
        "shop_loreRocketLauncher6": "Instead of using a normal explosion triggering mechanism, the rockets instead use the blood of the target to complete the chemical reaction, making the generation process safe, though the weapon is more difficult to use as it requires direct hits to cause damage.",
        "shop_loreRocketLauncher7": "The skill required for effective use makes it daunting, though its power more than makes up for it, and many of its wielders specifically chose to use it as a symbol of their skill at marksmanship.",
        "shop_loreRocketLauncher8": "Rockets only cause a damage-dealing explosion when hitting a living target directly, but missing on purpose can be used to launch an enemy into the air, since a direct hit on a falling enemy causes a larger, more damaging explosion.",
        "shop_loreRocketLauncher9": "The launcher requires very little preparation to be used, meaning it can be quickly pulled out, fired and put back away to deal a quick burst of extra damage in the middle of another weapon switching combo.",
        "shop_loreRocketLauncher10": "Rockets are pulled by the Magnet nailgun's magnets, though not as strongly as nails. The accuracy of the tracking can be increased by freezing rockets with the Freezeframe variation.",
        "shop_loreRocketLauncher11": "When hit with the Whiplash, a rocket will be attached to the spear without stopping the throw. If the spear doesn't collide with anything else, the rocket will be pulled back with it, exploding on collision with the user.",
        "shop_loreRocketLauncher12": "Light enemies will be airborne when pulled by the Whiplash, making them very easy targets to hit for the falling enemy explosion bonus. However, this requires a lot of distance from the target if the user wishes to avoid the explosion's increased radius.",
        "shop_loreRocketLauncher13": "Some machines, such as V1, are light enough to ride a rocket. This can be achieved by freezing a rocket with the Freezeframe variation and jumping onto it. Even with the low weight, the rocket will eventually lose power, causing it to drop gradually, but when underwater, V1 is light enough to not cause this drop.",

        "enemyBios_filth_4": "Even among Husks, they have the lowest intelligence, driven purely by hunger.",
        
        "enemyBios_filth_strategy1": "Most weapons are easily capable of taking down Filth, but their powerful jaws and sheer numbers can overwhelm a target quickly if underestimated.",

        "enemyBios_stray_strategy1": "Most weapons will be effective against them, but a Revolver headshot is the quickest and surest way to eliminate a Stray.",
        "enemyBios_stray_strategy2": "Due to their static nature and slow rate of attacking, they are an excellent target for projectile parrying.",
        
        "enemyBios_schism_1": "The result of two souls attempting to manifest in the same space, causing an amalgamation of two physical bodies. ",
        "enemyBios_schism_2": "Due to the doubled body mass, they're quite resilient to damage, but have very poor motor control and thus cannot aim with any degree of accuracy, resorting to barrages of energy orbs in the general direction of their opponent.",

        "enemyBios_soldier_strategy2": "Since Soldiers charge their shots in front of them rather than above them, the charge is also easier to interrupt via a precise revolver shot for an explosive kill.",
        "enemyBios_soldier_strategy3": "Thanks to their augmentations, Soldiers are able to withstand normal explosions with little to no damage. The more powerful red explosions will go through their guard however, and they are unable to block if not on the ground.",

        "enemyBios_ferryman_3": "Due to the holy power emanating from the cloth, Ferrymen's skeletal bodies have slowly been colored bright and radiant, and their skulls have enough latent energy to open gates that otherwise stop Husks from exiting their places of torment.",
        "enemyBios_ferryman_4": "Each ferry can only have one Ferryman at a time, so when a new Ferryman is formed, it will fight another to the death in order to take their place and inherit their cloth. The loser's skull is taken as a trophy and used to grant the winner passage across the layers in order to transport the souls of the damned to their destinations.",

        "enemyBios_ferryman_strategy4": "Ferrymen may attempt to cross a retreating opponent up by rolling behind them before attacking. Keep track of their position and if they roll too often, try being more aggressive.",
        
        "enemyBios_idol_1": "Although they can easily be mistaken to be of divine origin, Idols were created using the same process as other demons. Unlike their larger kin, their shells were too small to contain a useful amount of Hell Mass, creating life, but leaving it unable to move or act.",
        "enemyBios_idol_2": "The Idols did not originally look divine, but were painstakingly carved to such shapes by Ferrymen who collected them during travels across the layers of Hell. This was done as both an act of compassion and as a tribute to angels, particularily Gabriel, whom Ferrymen believe to have similarily granted them mercy.",
        "enemyBios_idol_3": "Close proximity to a Ferryman's holy cloth during the long and arduous carving process caused its holy power to seep into them, allowing them to continue the chain of compassion by protecting others from physical harm.",
        "enemyBios_idol_4": "It is fortunate for them that Gabriel is the only angel of Heaven's higher order to watch over Hell, since if the Council had found out about such beings, they would have been labelled perversions of the divine form and ordered to be destroyed by the Ferrymen who so lovingly had granted them a chance at life.",
        
        "enemyBios_idol_strategy1": "Although Idols are immune to projectiles, they can be destroyed by a blunt force melee attack such as a punch or a ground slam.",
        "enemyBios_idol_strategy2": "Blessed enemies cannot be damaged by attacks, but will still be pushed by physical forces and can be killed by environmental dangers, such as crushers or fans.",

        "enemyBios_leviathan_1": "Unlike most demons, the Leviathan is not formed from generic Hell Mass, but instead from the bodies of the Sullen, a name used for those in the Ocean Styx who have given up fighting for air and instead lay at the bottom of the ocean, drowning eternally.",
        "enemyBios_leviathan_2": "The Sullen, in their motionlessness, were eventually fused together by the same force that created the other demons, becoming the biblical Leviathan, an abomination prophesized to be at the end of the world.",
        "enemyBios_leviathan_3": "The heart, which houses the souls of the Sullen in endless anguish as their flesh, veins and nerves writhe and mutate, attempted to escape its body, but Gabriel struck it down with his divine spears, pinning it back onto its head, unable to move.",
        "enemyBios_leviathan_4": "Although the world ended, the Leviathan remains trapped in the Ocean Styx, growing ever longer as more of Wrath's sinners give up and sink to the bottom.",
        
        "enemyBios_leviathan_strategy1": "The Leviathan's heart is exposed on top of its head, making it a clear weakpoint to aim for. Although it's usually not visible, it can be seen after the Leviathan's attacks, opening an opportunity for direct damage, or for landing a magnet.",
        "enemyBios_leviathan_strategy2": "Although ill-advised, it is possible to ride the Leviathan for a short period of time. A well-timed jump will allow one to dodge the Leviathan's bite attack as well as land on its head near its exposed heart.",
        "enemyBios_leviathan_strategy3": "The tail will either swing high or low, and the height of the swing can be determined by the direction in which the swing rotates.",
        
        "enemyBios_corpseOfKingMinos_1": "Once the great and beloved king of the Lust layer, Minos has now been reduced to a shambling corpse.",
        "enemyBios_corpseOfKingMinos_2": "Due to his incredible power of will and status as a just ruler in life remembered even millenia after his death, the manifestation of his soul is the largest Husk to ever have been recorded.",
        "enemyBios_corpseOfKingMinos_3": "Small traces of the original soul can still be detected in the body, but the corpse itself is animated and controlled entirely by the snakelike Parasites that he once commanded.",
        "enemyBios_corpseOfKingMinos_4": "Despite once bringing upon the renaissance of the Lust layer, his corpse now only seeks sinners to punish.",
        
        "enemyBios_corpseOfKingMinos_strategy1": "Due to his large stature, it can be quite difficult to recover blood from him, but his hands are usually holding on to the walls of the arena, which can be used for refueling.",
        "enemyBios_corpseOfKingMinos_strategy2": "Any weapon will work against an enemy this large, but melee and projectile parries make for a quick way to inflict grave damage.",
        "enemyBios_corpseOfKingMinos_strategy3": "Although it moves slowly, the Black Hole he summons is extremely dangerous and cannot be destroyed.",
        
        "enemyBios_stalker_1": "As the Greed layer's punishment, Stalkers have been forced to carry heavy boulders up the monuments of mankind's greed for all eternity.",
        "enemyBios_stalker_2": "They have carried out their punishment for so long that their bodies have evolved, warped and grown to better suit it.",
        "enemyBios_stalker_3": "Their limbs have twisted to give them better balance while carrying boulders on their backs and their skin and muscles have completely dried up, allowing them to survive direct contact with the dunes of gold dust that Greed's sun has raised to unfathomably high temperatures.",
        "enemyBios_stalker_4": "However, an unidentified sentient force has replaced the boulders they would normally carry with high tech bombs that, upon detonation, will transform any nearby blood into the gold dust \"sand\" that covers the layer's surface.",
        "enemyBios_stalker_5": "Research has shown the technology to be very similar to the augmentations of the modified Strays known as Soldiers, so it is likely both modifications come from the same source.",
        
        "enemyBios_stalker_strategy1": "The lights on the canister give information on a Stalker's state. The color shows the state of their explosive and the brightness of the color shows how much health the Stalker has left.",
        "enemyBios_stalker_strategy2": "It's advisable to forcibly detonate a Stalker rather than allowing one to detonate itself, as the latter explosion will have a larger area of effect.",
        "enemyBios_stalker_strategy3": "If a Stalker gets close to its target and can no longer be pushed away, a ground slam wave can launch them out of range so they can be detonated safely in mid-air, since the explosion is mostly horizontal.",
        "enemyBios_stalker_strategy4": "Attaching magnets to a Stalker will reduce the radius of its detonation.",
        
        "enemyBios_insurrectionist_1": "The Sisyphean Insurrectionists were an army of Husks gathered and trained by King Sisyphus for overthrowing Heaven's control of Hell, freeing the sinners from their eternal torment.",
        "enemyBios_insurrectionist_2": "During an era of chaos in Heaven, as the angelic watch was absent, Sisyphus began setting his plan in motion as his forces recruited all Husks that were intelligent enough to be useful to their cause and began attacking the demons that wandered the dunes of Greed.",
        "enemyBios_insurrectionist_3": "Upon the establishment of the Council and subsequent return of peace to Heaven, Gabriel and an army of angels were sent down to crush the insurrection and subjugate Sisyphus' army.",
        "enemyBios_insurrectionist_4": "Although their battle was well-fought, the inexperienced Insurrectionists could not match the educated strategy of the angels, who quickly descended upon King Sisyphus with great force, eventually overpowering and killing him, leaving the Insurrectionists without a chain of command.",
        "enemyBios_insurrectionist_5": "Left scattered and disoriented, the warriors were easily picked off one by one, their bodies cut apart, leaving behind only the bare essentials required to carry on their eternal punishment of hauling heavy boulders up the monuments of mankind's arrogance and greed.",
        "enemyBios_insurrectionist_6": "Although the blood of their enemies still stains their bodies and their grasp still clutches their fallen foes, their will and fierce fury only serve as mental torment in knowing how close they were to freedom.",
        
        "enemyBios_insurrectionist_strategy1": "The Sisyphean Insurrectionists soak their feet in the blood of their enemies to protect them from the heat of Greed's dunes, but the rest of their body is still skin and flesh, which can be set aflame to greatly weaken their defences, increasing the damage of any attack dealt to them.",
        "enemyBios_insurrectionist_strategy2": "Though they have practically unlimited range, each of the Insurrectionist's swings has strengths and weaknesses. Learning which way to dodge to avoid each attack is vital.",
        "enemyBios_insurrectionist_strategy3": "The Insurrectionist's stomp is fast and destructive, so it's inadvisable to stay close for long.",
        "enemyBios_insurrectionist_strategy4": "The Malicious Face they wield as a weapon is not a part of their body, so hitting it will not deal damage to an Insurrectionist, but this also means that it can still be used to heal even if its wielder's blood has been turned to sand.",
        
        "enemyBios_swordsmachine_1": "Its original form is unrecognisable after years of scavenging scrap and rebuilding itself, but among scrapheads, the Swordsmachine is quite famous due to its combat prowess and selfmade form, ugly to most but beautiful to enthusiasts, spawning many copycats. ",
        "enemyBios_swordsmachine_2": "It wields a selfmade sword with a motor on it that, when revved, will heat the blade, cutting through most organic matter with ease. ",
        "enemyBios_swordsmachine_3": "Due to its possessive hoarding behavior, it's one of the few machines still capable of vocalization -- an ability most have discarded for more efficient resource management.",
        
        "enemyBios_swordsmachine_strategy1": "Despite its excellent performance against Hell's denizens, its design does not take into account extremely mobile opponents, so the best way to avoid its blade is to jump out of its vertical range.",
        "enemyBios_swordsmachine_strategy2": "Its motorized sword makes for predictable attacks, making the Swordsmachine an excellent target for parrying.",
        "enemyBios_swordsmachine_strategy3": "Although its use of ranged weapons is primitive at best, its sword throws can be unexpectedly accurate thanks to its mastery of the weapon.",
        
        "enemyBios_drone_1": "A mass-produced security device built as both a surveillance camera and a security guard.",
        "enemyBios_drone_2": "Though originally built to only use non-lethal ammunition, they have scavenged parts from the defunct machines on the surface for greater efficiency at collecting blood.",
        "enemyBios_drone_3": "Curious by nature, but to keep production costs low, their intelligence is very limited.",
        
        "enemyBios_drone_strategy1": "Due to their light weight, physical projectiles such as nails will push them around, making them harder to deal consistent damage to.",
        "enemyBios_drone_strategy2": "On death they will make a last ditch effort to harm their opponent with a self-destruct, but powerful single attacks and explosives will make them explode instantly.",
        "enemyBios_drone_strategy3": "Punching a drone will redirect their suicide dive, making them a high-risk offensive opportunity.",
        "enemyBios_drone_strategy4": "Their scanning mechanism makes a chirping sound, which can be listened for to make them easier to track down, as their flight and small size can lead them to hard to reach places.",
        
        "enemyBios_streetcleaner_1": "Originally built as a way to purify the tainted air of cities after the climate catastrophe, Streetcleaners were made obsolete during the New Peace, and were repurposed as scouts for Hell expeditions.",
        "enemyBios_streetcleaner_2": "However, their urge to clean remained, and after the fall of mankind, they began burning any organic matter they came across in an effort to purify the world.",
        
        "enemyBios_streetcleaner_strategy1": "Due to their combat experience, they can be tricky to take down with projectiles or explosives.",
        "enemyBios_streetcleaner_strategy2": "The canister on their back is a major weakpoint that can be shattered with a precision shot, such as a Marksman coin ricochet from behind.",
        "enemyBios_streetcleaner_strategy3": "Point-blank attacks can also be very efficient, but must be performed quickly to avoid the fire of their flamethrowers.",
        
        "enemyBios_v2_1": "The V model was built for war, with V1 boasting a new kind of exterior plating that allowed refueling through contact with blood rather than through a separate blood refueling process.",
        "enemyBios_v2_2": "Due to its necessary thinness, it is far less durable, but the ability to fix itself and rebuild broken parts on the fly would outweigh the negatives on an active battlefield.",
        "enemyBios_v2_3": "However, during the prototyping phase, the New Peace was established and war became irrelevant.",
        "enemyBios_v2_4": "V1's planned production was cancelled and an updated model, V2, was developed instead, using the standardized plating, since durability was far more important during times of peace when no bloodshed was necessary.",
        "enemyBios_v2_5": "Neither model ever reached mass production due to the end of wars completely draining any demand, so it's likely only a single prototype build of each model remains in existence.",
        
        "enemyBios_v2_strategy1": "V2 is adept at controlling space and will take advantage of this to change the flow of battle to throw off its opponent. Stay too close and it will run away. Stay far away and it will come close.",
        "enemyBios_v2_strategy2": "V2's high mobility makes it a tricky target to hit, and especially difficult to heal off of. When in need of blood and unable to catch up, it's instead recommended to stay away from it and let it come to you instead.",
        "enemyBios_v2_strategy3": "V2 will switch weapons depending on the distance from its target, so if one of its weapons is difficult to avoid, a change in proximity will close it off.",
        "enemyBios_v2_strategy4": "Knowledge of the synergies of one's own arsenal can allow one to turn V2's weapons against it.",
        
        "enemyBios_mindflayer_1": "Rare but extremely dangerous, the Mindflayer is a machine that has adapted and mastered the use of Hell Energy alongside its own technological prowess.",
        "enemyBios_mindflayer_2": "The machine itself is only the top part of its apparent body, the rest of which is a plastic shell in the form of a human, which they seem to have built themselves.",
        "enemyBios_mindflayer_3": "The plastic body serves no function and is only for aesthetic purposes.",
        "enemyBios_mindflayer_4": "Despite it being a waste of resources, Mindflayers will use everything in its power to protect the plastic body from harm, even if that means destroying itself in the process.",
        "enemyBios_mindflayer_5": "Mindflayers seem to prefer a female form, though very rare occasions of male forms have also been recorded.",
        
        "enemyBios_mindflayer_strategy1": "When encountering a Mindflayer, it's imperative to keep track of their actions either through visuals or audio.",
        "enemyBios_mindflayer_strategy2": "Due to their homing projectiles being fired in a burst, a safe explosive such as a Knuckleblaster blastwave is the most efficient in deflecting them.",
        "enemyBios_mindflayer_strategy3": "Their instant teleportation can make consistent positional advantage quite difficult, but a Screwdriver drill will temporarily stop them from teleporting.",
        
        "enemyBios_sentry_1": "One of the many war machines created during the Final War. Although there were attempts to find new purpose for them during the New Peace, their streamlined design made them unable to be repurposed until the start of the Hell expeditions.",
        "enemyBios_sentry_2": "Their extremely powerful legs and feet allow them to dig into the ground, making them immovable by most forces and allowing them to easily line up any shot without interruption.",
        "enemyBios_sentry_3": "Despite their size, they were built to be extremely light, which when combined with the power of their legs, allows them to move at extremely fast speeds. Such power and lightness have made their legs one of the most sought after parts by scrapheads.",
        "enemyBios_sentry_4": "Most machines will only render a simplified approximation of their visual surroundings for faster processing speed, but Sentries use full renders instead, giving them perfect accuracy even over extremely long distances.",
        
        "enemyBios_sentry_strategy1": "Due to their powerful legs, once they've dug into the ground to aim, they can no longer move.",
        "enemyBios_sentry_strategy2": "Once dug in, the only ways to interrupt their attack are: Shooting them with the Electric Railcannon, hitting their antenna with the Revolver, launching them with the ground slam wave or punching them with the Knuckleblaster.",
        "enemyBios_sentry_strategy3": "As long as they haven't dug in, their light weight makes them easy to launch and keep in the air where they are harmless.",
        "enemyBios_sentry_strategy4": "A good way to disable a Sentry for a longer period of time is to shoot nails into them with the Nailgun and then placing a magnet in a nearby wall or ceiling, which will pull them once they've been knocked off balance.",
        
        "enemyBios_v2Second_1": "After its defeat and escape, V2 dove deeper into Hell, killing other machines for their blood to help its recovery with the intent of taking revenge on V1 and recovering its original arm.",
        "enemyBios_v2Second_2": "After finding a temporary replacement from one of its victims, V2 used parts from other machines to transform the new placeholder arm into a mobility tool that would allow it to catch up to V1's fast descent into the deeper layers.",
        "enemyBios_v2Second_3": "In order to prepare for their second and final encounter, it researched the combat data from their previous battle to copy strategies and techniques from the older and more experienced V1 to give itself an upper hand.",
        "enemyBios_v2Second_4": "However, despite all its preparation, V2 lost again, and unable to escape this time, was brought to a swift and decisive end by its predecessor.",
        
        "enemyBios_v2Second_strategy1": "Although V2's coins may seem extremely dangerous at first, they are also an excellent opportunity for high damage if shot before V2 can.",
        "enemyBios_v2Second_strategy2": "V2's nailgun can be circumvented or turned against itself via Magnets.",
        "enemyBios_v2Second_strategy3": "Hitting V2 with its own arm will cause it to enrage instantly.",
        
        "enemyBios_maliciousFace_1": "Demons are creatures born from the mass of Hell. They are most easily recognisable by their hard stone-like exterior and slow movement.",
        "enemyBios_maliciousFace_2": "Demons have higher intelligence than Husks, but are still incapable of rational thought and communication. No demons have been able to pass the mirror test, though studies are limited due to their hostility.",
        "enemyBios_maliciousFace_3": "Malicious Faces are the most common type of demon, but are incredibly dangerous, especially in swarms, due to their mastery of the use of Hell Energy as a weapon.",
        
        "enemyBios_maliciousFace_strategy1": "Due to their burst fire, they can be quite difficult to get close to, so despite the effectiveness of a point blank shotgun shot, nails are the recommended course of action, with magnets enabling long-range combat.",
        "enemyBios_maliciousFace_strategy2": "Due to their invulnerability to explosions, they don't need to hold back the energy of their beam attacks, so staying away from walls and other surfaces is recommended when they begin charging an energy beam.",
        
        "enemyBios_cerberus_1": "Although they do not resemble the mythological three-headed dog, this name was chosen due to their nature as protectors of Hell. However, it's not yet known why some stay dormant despite provocation.",
        "enemyBios_cerberus_2": "Despite the fact that keeping an energy orb stable takes a considerable amount of focus and effort, they seem to always keep one in hand, most likely as a display of their power to scare off intruders.",
        
        "enemyBios_cerberus_strategy1": "Due to remaining entirely stationary until awoken, they move quite slowly, so engagement distance is easy to control.",
        "enemyBios_cerberus_strategy2": "They're quite adept at ranged combat by throwing their orb, but in order to avoid damaging themselves, they will not initiate a throw while their target is close, which can be used to manipulate their behavior, though once a throw has started, it cannot be stopped.",
        "enemyBios_cerberus_strategy3": "Due to the extreme concentration of their energy orbs, thrown ones explode on physical impact, so staying close to surfaces such the floor or any walls will make avoiding ranged attacks more difficult.",
        
        "enemyBios_hideousMass_1": "Hideous Masses are a rare occurrence, when an excessive amount of Hell Mass is poured into a single shell, causing it to overflow and burst at the seams.",
        "enemyBios_hideousMass_2": "Due to the broken seams allowing for mobility without having to bend the exterior, the stone has hardened more than the shell of most demons, making it completely impervious to all currently known attacks.",
        
        "enemyBios_hideousMass_strategy1": "Although its stone exterior makes for an impenetrable defense, the Hideous Mass' belly and tail remain exposed and vulnerable.",
        "enemyBios_hideousMass_strategy2": "While standing up, a quick burst of close range damage is the most effective way to hurt them, though this will most likely cause it to change formations, so being quick and decisive is the key.",
        "enemyBios_hideousMass_strategy3": "When in its low formation, keeping a safe distance is recommended due to its melee capabilities and high speed tail harpoon, though the brave or suicidal may attempt to climb on its back to continue dealing close range damage to the tail.",
        "enemyBios_hideousMass_strategy4": "When caught by the harpoon, it's recommendable to either punch the harpoon or damage the tail to remove it.",
        
        "enemyBios_gabriel_1": "One of the most respected and feared archangels, Gabriel earned his reputation through power and efficiency.",
        "enemyBios_gabriel_2": "Regardless of the task given, Gabriel would always perform it quickly and decisively, earning him the title of Judge of Hell after dethroning Minos and ending the Lust renaissance.",
        "enemyBios_gabriel_3": "Despite answering to the Council, he is far more popular and beloved among angels due to his radiant personality and active nature, especially compared to the Council that strictly follows and upholds the dogma of the Faith.",
        
        "enemyBios_gabriel_strategy1": "Gabriel's movements are fast and his attacks are deadly, but by observing which weapon he manifests, his attacks can be accurately predicted before he even starts them.",
        "enemyBios_gabriel_strategy2": "Gabriel's pride stops him from attacking while taunting his opponent, opening up a short window for healing.",
        
        "enemyBios_gabrielSecond_1": "Having twice clashed with the machine and lost, Gabriel realized he had been mistaken. The strong fire that burned inside him was not hatred at all, but passion.",
        "enemyBios_gabrielSecond_2": "Gabriel had never before known the joy of a struggle, of coming face-to-face with an opponent of equal or greater measure. Though he had lost twice, each loss only further grew his desire to overcome.",
        "enemyBios_gabrielSecond_3": "Up until now, he had only done what was expected of him, but now for the first time he had found something he himself wanted. Not even the fast encroaching End of Hell mattered to him anymore.",
        "enemyBios_gabrielSecond_4": "Still, having come to realize the horrors he had committed in God's name, he felt a great guilt. Though he could not undo what he had done, Gabriel knew he had to make things right, and headed to Hell for the last time.",
        
        "enemyBios_gabrielSecond_strategy1": "While Gabriel's speed has increased, his accuracy has not. Dodging diagonally or to the side will prove more fruitful than trying to run backwards out of the range of his swords.",
        "enemyBios_gabrielSecond_strategy2": "Though his sword throw may seem impossible to dodge, it will prove an excellent weapon if parried instead.",
        "enemyBios_gabrielSecond_strategy3": "Overcome with emotion, Gabriel will sometimes stop to taunt his opponent, creating a window for healing.",
        
        "enemyBios_virtue_1": "The basis of a lesser angel's forming are quite similar to that of the Husks', wherein the physical manifestation of the soul is dependant on its value, though unlike for Husks, virtuousness also acts as a factor for angels.",
        "enemyBios_virtue_2": "Lesser angels come from human souls, which are formed into abstract or animalistic shapes, making them distinct from the humanoid bodies of greater and supreme angels, who were created as such and are considered purer and placed higher on Heaven's societal hierarchy.",
        "enemyBios_virtue_3": "Due to their past lives as humans, Virtues are often sent to complete tasks that greater angels deem below them or otherwise uninteresting, such as acting as wardens in Hell. There Virtues use heavenly fire to punish sinners who aren't acting out their punishment, in order to not waste Gabriel's time with minor offences and fluctuations.",
        "enemyBios_virtue_4": "Virtues are normally known to have a multitude of eyes, though for unknown reasons, these eyes are hidden or removed for ones that become wardens in Hell. Some have speculated this may be related to why almost all husks lack eyes, with the only verified exception being the previous Judge of Hell, King Minos.",
        "enemyBios_virtue_5": "Little is known about the specifics of angels, as Heaven is exclusionary and segregated due to wanting little to no direct contact with God's human experiment.",
        
        "enemyBios_virtue_strategy1": "Verticality and cover give little safety against the Virtue's light beams, so constant horizontal movement is encouraged, though retracing one's steps can be dangerous as the beams linger.",
        "enemyBios_virtue_strategy2": "If ignored for too long, Virtues will enrage, making their light beams predict their target's movement. Although it's easy to avoid their attacks with enough space, leaving them unattended can quickly turn the tables in their favor",
        
        "enemyBios_somethingWicked_1": "Very little is known about this creature. ",
        "enemyBios_somethingWicked_2": "Some speculate it to be a Husk, but due to its elusive and extremely hostile nature, no one has been able to confirm the hypothesis.",
        "enemyBios_somethingWicked_3": "Only one has ever been observed and it has never been seen leaving the section of the Mouth of Hell in which it currently resides.",
        
        "enemyBios_somethingWicked_strategy1": "Any attack will temporarily cause it to relocate, but there are no known ways to kill it.",
        "enemyBios_somethingWicked_strategy2": "Its way of attacking is unknown outside of the fact that it happens on physical contact, but no amount of protection has saved any of its victims.",
        
        "enemyBios_fleshPrison_1": "Flesh Prison is an uncategorized organism created by the angels to imprison Minos' soul after he was slain by Gabriel.",
        "enemyBios_fleshPrison_2": "Although it is similar to Husks, it does not possess a soul or any amount of thought. All of its actions are purely predetermined reactions to stimulus, making it more of an organic machine than a living being.",
        "enemyBios_fleshPrison_3": "In order to make it as impenetrable as possible, it was given both divine power and hell energy, which makes its attacks erratic and chaotic.",
        
        "enemyBios_fleshPrison_strategy1": "Flesh Prison will use its spawn to heal its own wounds. The more spawn are left, the more likely it is for Flesh Prison to attempt to heal its wounds, so it's advisable to avoid damaging it until the spawn are dead.",
        "enemyBios_fleshPrison_strategy2": "The long window of a delayed split shot timing makes for a great way to clear out multiple spawn at once. Throwing multiple coins high into the air and waiting for them to reach the delayed split shot state before shooting them is a strong opening move after Flesh Prison creates its spawn.",
        
        "enemyBios_minosPrime_1": "A prime soul is an incredibly rare occurrence in which a soul amasses so much power that it no longer requires a Husk as a vessel to manifest physically.",
        "enemyBios_minosPrime_2": "As manifestations of pure will, prime souls are incredibly powerful, to the point that even the prideful angels see them as a threat and will use any means necessary to stop them from forming.",
        "enemyBios_minosPrime_3": "King Minos felt that eternal suffering was an unfair and unreasonable punishment for those whose only sin was loving another. After the Disappearance of God, as angels were lost and Heaven was in chaos, Minos began his efforts to reform the Lust layer.",
        "enemyBios_minosPrime_4": "The Lust renaissance was prosperous, as King Minos guided its inhabitants to come together and build a new civilization. The combined efforts of the countless who had been damned to the second layer bore great results as the grand city of Lust grew and grew.",
        "enemyBios_minosPrime_5": "However, after the Council took control of Heaven and brought stability to it through their iron fist rule, they saw that Minos had gone against God's will by freeing sinners from the punishment that God had designed for them.",
        "enemyBios_minosPrime_6": "Gabriel, the brightest of the angels, was sent to kill Minos. The king, rather than fight back, tried to reason with him, but Gabriel mercilessly struck him down without listening.",
        "enemyBios_minosPrime_7": "As Minos' will was strong enough to attempt to stand up to Heaven's rule, the angels chose to imprison his soul in an attempt to stop it from forming into a prime soul and appointed Gabriel as the new Judge of Hell.",
        "enemyBios_minosPrime_8": "From the prison inside his own body, Minos helplessly watched as his soulless corpse, now controlled by parasites, tore apart everything he had worked so hard to build, cursing his own weakness for failing to protect his people, vowing to take revenge...",
        
        "enemyBios_minosPrime_strategy1": "It's rare for Minos Prime to give a window of opportunity to heal, so it's vital to learn what attacks leave him momentarily vulnerable and how to dodge them in a way that gives an advantageous position during those moments.",
        "enemyBios_minosPrime_strategy2": "His snake projectiles can be parried using the Feedbacker for a full heal, even if the projectile doesn't hit Minos Prime."
