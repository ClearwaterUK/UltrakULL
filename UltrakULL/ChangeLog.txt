- Fixed a long-standing issue with the introduction missing the recalibration prompt due to a hacky implementation.
(NOTE: Due to a refactoring of necessary code, **this will undo a previous fix where a specific accent character - Ä - would cause a softlock in the intro.** I have contacted a game dev to ask if they are able to change this in the game code for next game update/hotfix. Until then, please refrain from using this character in intro strings.)

0.8.2 EMERGENCY FIX

0.8.2

- Reverted a section of patched code that was causing a major bug where saves would not be saved and deleted correctly. I will look into a working fix for this at a later date. (Liquid)
NOTE: This reversion will make the save deletion confirmation text revert back to English.
- Added a new "Language" tab in the options menu. Full credit to Temperz87 fof the UI code.
(NOTE: A lot of the functionality in here is not yet working pending future development)
- Added a check to make sure the version of a JSON language file matches that of the current mod version. If a JSON file's version does not match the current version of the mod, you will receieve warning messages in-console and in-game regarding potential missing strings.
(NOTE: In future, outdated or mismatched files will be skipped over, however a file can be force loaded at any time by setting it in lastLang.)
- Added strings for the Sandbox tab and descriptions in the shop.

- Fixed an inconsistency in the tutorial intro text.
- Changed the color of the assist options to use lime instead of blue. This is due to the hex color tag that was being used being broken. Normal colors still work fine, so this string will use a lime color until it has been fixed.
