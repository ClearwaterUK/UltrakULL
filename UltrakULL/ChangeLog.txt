1.1.1
- **Added basic support for Right-to-left languages, such as Arabic and Hebrew.**
(**Note**: To set RTL encoding for your language, set langRTL in your JSON metadata to "true" (all lowercase). See JSON changes below.)
- A big backend cleanup and refactor effort has been done. This should not affect any functionality of the mod, but if any problems arise, please report them.
- More fixes in the English template.
- Fixed Gabriel's lines in 6-1 not working correctly when dubbing is enabled.
- Fixed a missing line not displaying in the Act 1 intermission.
- Added the following lines to the JSON template:

metadata: langRTL


1.1.0
- **Added dialogue language support for spoken characters.** Documentation on how to add your own lines can be found on the GitHub. https://github.com/ClearwaterTM/UltrakULL/blob/1.1.0/UltrakULL/docs/Dubbing.md
- Added a button to the audio options, which enables or disables dubbing of spoken characters. If disabled, characters will use the original English dialog.
- Added a basic update checker. If a newer version of UltrakULL is detected on the GitHub, a message will display on the main menu, as well as a button to 
obtain the update.
(**NOTE**: Due to file and security limitations, it is not possible for the mod to auto-update itself. Updates must be manually downloaded and installed.)
- Updated UMM version used from 0.4.3 to 0.5.0. (Thanks Temperz)
(NOTE: From UltrakULL 1.1.0 onwards, UMM 0.5.0 is now the minimum required version to work. 1.1.0 will contain versions for both UMM 0.4.3 and 0.5.0)
- Fixed the teleport menu panel not using a translated string.

- Added the following lines to the JSON template:

options: audio_dubbing

1.0.2

- Fixed a rare case of 4-4 Whiplash HUD messages not displaying correctly if they are triggered without picking up the Whiplash dropped by V2.
- Fixed save slot titles not being translated in the save selection menu.

- Fixed some instances of testament titles in secret levels not being translated.
- Updated the README.


1.0.1

- Updated the README on the GitHub to reflect new installation process, as well as new collaborators and available languages.
- Changed the name of the default language that the mod attempts to load when starting for the first time ("en-GB"). This fixes a bug related to being unable to load a language file on first-time startup.
- Added a cross-mod fix when running UltrakULL with UltraTweaker. If both are detected, UltrakULL will move its language button in the options to a different location to avoid overlap.
- Added a button to the Language tab that opens the language folder in Windows, to help simplify the process for adding new language files.

0.8.2

(NOTE: A lot of the functionality in here is not yet working pending future development)
